# Chest X-ray Medical Image Retrieval System

=> I made a Chest X-ray Medical Image Retrieval System using Vision Transformers (ViT) and Contrastive Learning.

=> The system achieves state-of-the-art performance with a Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.8%, demonstrating 
its capability for highly accurate medical image retrieval.

=> The system is designed to retrieve the most relevant chest X-ray images from a database, aiding in
diagnostic and comparative analysis.

# Features
1. Retrieval of similar chest X-ray images based on query input from test data.
2. Use of Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction.
3. Contrastive learning for effective embedding space representation with modified contrastive loss function and differential regularization.
4. Performance evaluation using metrics such as Mean Average Precision (mAP), Precision@K, and Recall@K.
